# Movieport
A film\TV show tracking app.

Overview:
A personal portfolio project for tracking films and TV shows. While inspired by Letterboxd, it provides a unique system for managing and displaying content. Users can create accounts, track watched titles, like films or shows, maintain a watchlist, and organize content into custom lists. The app dynamically fetches, filters, and displays data using TMDb as the primary API with OMDb as a backup.

Features:
Secure user authentication with JWT. Track watched films and TV shows. Like titles and add them to a watchlist. Create and manage custom lists. Dynamic display of API data with filtering and smooth interactions.

Tech Stack:
Frontend built with Vite and React, styled with TailwindCSS, and enhanced with Framer Motion for animations. Axios handles API requests. Backend uses Django and Django REST Framework, with PostgreSQL as the database.

Highlights:
Full end-to-end project designed for scalability and easy feature integration. Clean, consistent, and organized styling throughout. Demonstrates modern web development practices in a portfolio-ready project.

Note:
Some features are static for now; missing functionality will be implemented soon.
